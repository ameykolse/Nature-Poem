 Whispers of the woods, with gentle leaves sway,
Benevolent air, everything gleams.
Towering mountains, cerulean and bright,
Flow of the waves, guides to peaceful dreams.

Horizon extends, adorning the fields,
Roses blush red, lilies pure arise.
Birdsong resounds, filling hearts with delight,
Wondrous nature, adorns the clear skies.

Gentle rivers flow through serene valleys,
Under the radiant sun, a fresh earth blooms.
Time slips away, eternity remains,
Nature teaches us, truth it resumes.
